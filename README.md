# IPNS-Link-Gateway Registry

- If you are hosting a [public IPNS-Link-Gateway](https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway#cloud-hosting), this is where you let the world know about it. Just create an [issue](https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway/pulls) and we shall take care of the rest.
- If you want to report an offensive site so that all well-meaning IPNS-Link-Gateways might block it after due diligence, create an [issue](https://github.com/ipns-link/ipns-link-gateway/issues) telling us all you can tell.
- The list can be found [here.](https://github.com/ipns-link/gateway-registry/blob/main/list.md)

We thank you for your contribution.
